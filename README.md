# Necrocard

Necrocard was created in 72 hours for the WOWIE 3 game jam. It doesn't contain the absolute best code i've ever written,
but it does server as a nice example for a simple game made using [Pile](https://github.com/EinScott/Pile) (which you will need to build it).

I'll *sort of* try to keep this compatible with the current version of Pile but I won't make any promises... checked with Pile 3.0 @ 7cfd386
